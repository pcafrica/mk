# Job Scheduler
# WARNING: these variable should be set only if a job scheduler is available.
#
# MPI implementations support different job scheduler, this can improve the
# runtime perfomance of MPI. Variable TM contains the name of job scheduler
# and its version, until now only PBSPro is supported:
#   TM=PBSPro
# If the job scheduler is already installed in your system you could specify
# the installation prefix, for PBSPro is mandatory because it is available
# only in binary format
#   TMPREFIX=<job scheduler installation prefix>

# InfiniBand
# MPI implementations include support for high-speed interconnect networks.
# You should specify the required drivers for your hardware setup separated
# by a space between round parantheses (bash array), the current set of
# supported driver is:
#   INFINIBAND=(cxgb3 cxgb4 ipath mlx4 mlx5 mthca nes ocrdma)
